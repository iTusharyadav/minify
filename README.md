## :classical_building: What is **Minify**?

**Minify** is your coding adventure map. It’s a collection of smaller, self-contained projects that I’ve built during my learning journey. Each one serves as a checkpoint where you can practice different skills and solve coding challenges. With each new project, you’ll unlock a new skill and move closer to becoming a coding champion!
